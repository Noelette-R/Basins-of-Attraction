# Basins-of-Attraction
This python script allows for the mapping of trajectories and classification of attractors. It can be used to model Basins of attraction for N-coupled phase oscillator systems.
The script consists of a number of callable functions, and parameters that can be adjusted to fit a specfic model. The system includes a defined ode_N function, this is the function the script was orginally designed for. To adjust the script to suit a different coupled slow-fast system, please download the script and change the ode_N(): function, if adding parameters make sure to update the definitaion of 'args'.
